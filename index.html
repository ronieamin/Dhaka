    <!-- Description Text -->
    <div class="text-justify">
    <p><strong>Dhaka</strong> is not a quiet, retiring place. The city, bursting with nearly 17 million people (most of whom often seem to be stuck in the same traffic jam as you), is a gloriously noisy and chaotic place, bubbling with energy.</p>
      
      <p>It's a city that can sometimes threaten to overwhelm the casual visitor, but once you climb into the back of one of its myriad colourful cycle-rickshaws, Dhaka's charm starts to slowly reveal itself. Life flows from the boats on the Buriganga River to its unexpectedly green parks and university campuses. Mughal and British monuments speak of its history, its mosques of its spiritual side, and the thriving information technology and arts scenes â€“ give a glimpse of the direction of future.</p>
      
      <p>However, the most distinct feature of Dhaka is the human interactions that makes visiting Dhaka such a unique experience.</p>
